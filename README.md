# Workflow Aesthetics Tinder

Prod URL: https://workflow-aesthetics-tinder.vercel.app/

Local dev:

- `pnpm install`
- Delete or rename `vercel.json`
- `vercel dev`

I couldn't work out how to make a `vercel.json` that works both locally and while deployed, and I am not sure it's even possible. If I was using a regular Vite/React app in future with some serverless functions I'd use netlify instead of Vercel because it's a pain in the ass.
